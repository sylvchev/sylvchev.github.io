Unlike most existing approaches for anomaly detection, our method is built on a non-parametric framework exploiting the optimal transportation to estimate deviation from an observed distribution. We described the theoretical background of our method and demonstrate its effectiveness on two datasets: an industrial predictive maintenance task based on audio recording and a detection of anomalous breathing relying on brain signals. In this type of problem, no negative or faulty samples are seen during training and the objective is to detect any abnormal sample without raising false alarm. The proposed approach outperforms all state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection on the two considered datasets.},

	abstract = {This chapter focus on the different implementations of brain-computer interface (BCI) based on Steady-State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs). In offline BCI, feature extraction and the classification are performed at the end of the session, when all trials are available. Whereas, in on-line settings, they are performed several times during each trial, usually for each available epoch recorded by the electroencephalogram (EEG) device, enabling real-time and asynchronous BCI. A recent successful approach in feature extraction and signal processing for BCI is Riemannian geometry , which deals with covariance matrices. They capture the degree of correlation between several random variables, that is how the brain signals change relatively to each other. These techniques have demonstrated their benefit on several occasions, leading to winning algorithms in international competitions and to state-of-the-art results on renowned BCI benchmarks. After reviewing some of the most robust approaches in feature extraction for SSVEP, this chapter will introduce newer tools based on Riemannian geometry. With an application to SSVEP, this article shows through a comparison how Riemannian geometry allows one to easily define offline and online implementations that have better accuracies than state of the art.},

Studies on gait disorders are rare where there is an important variability in movement parameters between patients. Those patients could benefit the most from rehabilitation and assistive mechatronic devices; there is no generic controlling scheme or any dynamical gain indicator. This contribution introduces a bio-kinematic index which is called Neuro-motor index (NMI), based on electromyographic (EMG) and joint angles measurements. NMI is derived from the nonlinear regression with a combination of two co-contraction indices (CCI), which allows addressing the variability of walking situations. This new index is evaluated on patients with cerebral palsy and a stroke. Then, the estimation error was calculated in comparison with the other co-contraction indices. This estimation shows that this index has the highest signification of joint angles prediction. Thus it can be suitable in adaptive rehabilitation control for spasticity cases.},

By using co-contraction indexes (CCI), it is possible to accurately characterize human movement and joint stability. But when dealing with human movement disorders, no existing index allows to achieve neuro-motor control with bio-kinematic sensors. Thus, we propose a neuro-motor interactive method for lower-body exoskeleton control. A novel dynamic index called neuro-motor index (NMI) is introduced to estimate the relation between muscular co-contraction derived from electromyography signals (EMG) and joint angles. To estimate the correlation in the state space and enhance the precision of the NMI, we describe an estimation method relying on a two-way analysis of canonical correlation (CCA). A thorough assessment is presented, by conducting two studies on control subjects and on patients with abnormal gait in a medical environment. i) An offline study on control patients showed that NMI captures the complex variation induced by changing walking speed more accurately than CCI, ii) an online study, applied on successive gait cycles of patients with abnormal walk indicates that the existing CCI have a low accuracy related with joint angles while it is significantly higher with NMI.},

	abstract = {Spiking neurons seem to capture important characteristics of biological neurons with relatively simple models. Their main interest is their ability to code information as discrete events. We have investigated the possible contributions of these models to artficial vision. Due to vision constraints, particularly for processing time, we use simple spiking neural models. A spiking neuron network architecture is described for encoding and extracting saliencies, thanks to the discretization induced by spiking neurons. The saliency map is a combination, in space and temporal domain, of visual modality maps (contrasts, orientations and colors) for different spatial scales. We propose a neural ﬁltering method for building the modality maps. This method implements a process, similar to convolution ﬁltering, by gradual approximation : the more processing time is allowed to the algorithm, the better is the approximation. The architecture ranks the saliencies in the order of their interest, with the most important encoded ﬁrst. Another spiking neuron network, inspired by dynamic neural ﬁelds, is attached on top of the architecture, allowing to select the most salient region and to focus on. Experimental results point out that the architecture is able to extract saliencies in a sequence of images, to select the most salient region and to focus on this region, in presence of noise or when the saliency moves.},

Ces BCI ont connu un rapide essor grâce aux méthodes d'apprentissage statistique, mais elles font face à deux verrous scientifiques.
Le premier concerne la puissance du signal, qui est très faible, et les bruits environnants qui contaminent les enregistrements de signaux cérébraux, avec des niveaux bien supérieurs à celui du signal d'intérêt.
Le second point concerne les variabilités individuelles qui peuvent réduire les algorithmes à des prédictions au niveau de la chance pour 10 à 20{\textbackslash}\% des sujets.

Les travaux présentés dans ce manuscrit abordent les aspects tant expérimentaux que théoriques pour aborder ces deux problèmes.
Les approches en traitement du signal utilisées pour travailler sur les signaux cérébraux peuvent dans certains cas s'appliquer sur d'autres types séries temporelles, par exemple pour des applications industrielles sur la détection d'anomalie.

Studying electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from their associated covariance matrices allows the construction of a representation which is invariant to extrinsic perturbations. As covariance matrices should be estimated, this paper first presents a thorough study of all estimators conducted on real EEG recording. Working in Euclidean space with covariance matrices is known to be error-prone, one might take advantage of algorithmic advances in Riemannian geometry and matrix manifold to implement methods for Symmetric Positive-Definite (SPD) matrices. Nonetheless, existing classification algorithms in Riemannian spaces are designed for offline analysis. We propose a novel algorithm for online and asynchronous processing of brain signals, borrowing principles from semi-unsupervised approaches and following a dynamic stopping scheme to provide a prediction as soon as possible. The assessment is conducted on real EEG recording: this is the first study on Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) experimentations to exploit online classification based on Riemannian geometry. The proposed online algorithm is evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art SSVEP methods, which are based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). It is shown to improve both the classification accuracy and the information transfer rate in the online and asynchronous setup.},

	abstract = {Symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices permeates numerous scientific disciplines, including machine learning, optimization, and signal processing. Equipped with a Riemannian geometry, the space of SPD matrices benefits from compelling properties and its derived Riemannian mean is now the gold standard in some applications, eg brain-computer interfaces (BCI). This paper addresses the problem of averaging covariance matrices with missing variables. This situation often occurs with inexpensive or unreliable sensors, or when artifact-suppression techniques remove corrupted sensors leading to rank deficient matrices, hindering the use of the Riemannian geometry in covariance-based approaches. An alternate but questionable method consists in removing the matrices with missing variables, thus reducing the training set size. We address those limitations and propose a new formulation grounded in geodesic convexity. Our approach is evaluated on generated datasets with a controlled number of missing variables and a known baseline, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed estimator. The practical interest of this approach is assessed on real BCI datasets. Our results show that the proposed average is more robust and better suited for classification than classical data imputation methods.},

	abstract = {Background: Neurofeedback (NF) training, as a method of self-regulation of brain activity, may be beneficial in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this pilot study, we investigated whether a sensorimotor (SMR)/theta NF training could improve cognitive performance and brain electrical activity in elderly patients with MCI.

Methods: Twenty elderly patients with MCI were assigned to 20 consecutive sessions of sensorimotor (SMR)/theta NF training, during 10 weeks, on a basis of two sessions each week. Neuropsychological assessments and questionnaires, as well as electroencephalogram (EEG), were performed and compared between baseline (T0), after the last NF training session at 10 weeks (T1), and 1-month follow-up (T2).

Results: Repeated measures ANOVA revealed that from baseline to post-intervention, participants showed significant improvement in the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCa, F = 4.78; p = 0.012), the delayed recall of the Rey auditory verbal learning test (RAVLT, F = 3.675; p = 0.032), the Forward digit span (F = 13.82; p {\textless} 0.0001), the Anxiety Goldberg Scale (F = 4.54; p = 0.015), the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Score–Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV; F = 24.75; p {\textless} 0.0001), and the Mac Nair score (F = 4.47; p = 0.016). EEG theta power (F = 4.44; p = 0.016) and alpha power (F = 3.84; p = 0.027) during eyes-closed resting-state significantly increased after the NF training and showed sustained improvement at a 1-month follow-up.

Conclusion: Our results suggest that NF training could be effective to reduce cognitive deficits in elderly patients with MCI and improve their EEG activity. If these findings are confirmed by randomized controlled studies with larger samples of patients, NF could be seen as a useful non-invasive, non-pharmacological tool for preventing further decline, rehabilitation of cognitive function in the elderly.

	abstract = {The severe respiratory distress syndrome linked to the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) includes unbearable dyspneic suffering which contributes to the deterioration of the prognosis of patients in intensive care unit (ICU). Patients are put on mechanical ventilation to reduce respiratory suffering and preserve life. Despite this mechanical ventilation, most patients continue to suffer from dyspnea. Dyspnea is a major source of suffering in intensive care and one of the main factors that affect the prognosis of patients. The development of innovative methods for its management, especially non-drug management is more than necessary. In recent years, numerous studies have shown that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) could modulate the perception of acute or chronic pain. In the other hand, it has been shown that the brain zones activated during pain and dyspnea are close and/or superimposed, suggesting that brain structures involved in the integration of aversive emotional component are shared by these two complex sensory experiences. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that stimulation by tDCS with regard to the areas which, in the case of pain have activated one or more of these brain structures, may also have an effect on dyspnea. In addition, our team recently demonstrated that the application of tDCS on the primary cortical motor area can modulate the excitability of the respiratory neurological pathways. Indeed, tDCS in anodal or cathodal modality reduced the excitability of the diaphragmatic cortico-spinal pathways in healthy subjects. We therefore hypothesized that tDCS could relieve dyspnea in COVID-19 patients under mechanical ventilation in ICU. This study was designed to evaluate effects of two modalities of tDCS (anodal and cathodal) vs. placebo, on the relief of dyspnea in COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation in ICU.},

	abstract = {Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) face a great challenge: how to harness the wide variability of brain signals from a user to another. The most visible problem is the lack of a sound framework to capture the specificity of a user brain waves. A first attempt to leverage this issue is to design user-specific spatial filters, carefully adjusted with a lengthy calibration phase. A second, more recent, opening is the systematic study of brain signals through their covariance, in an appropriate space from a geometric point of view. Riemannian geometry allows to efficiently characterize the variability of inter-subject EEG, even with noisy or scarce data. This contribution is the first attempt for SSVEP-based BCI to make the most of the available data from a user, relying on Riemannian geometry to estimate the similarity with a multi-user dataset. The proposed method is built in the framework of transfer learning and borrows the notion of composite mean to partition the space. This method is evaluated on 12 subjects performing an SSVEP task for the control of an exoskeleton arm and the results show the contribution of Riemannian geometry and of the user-specific composite mean, whereas there is only a few data available for a subject.},

	abstract = {In this introduction and review—like in the book which follows—we explore the hypothesis that adaptive growth is a means of producing brain-like machines. The emulation of neural development can incorporate desirable characteristics of natural neural systems into engineered designs. The introduction begins with a review of neural development and neural models. Next, artificial development— the use of a developmentally-inspired stage in engineering design—is introduced. Several strategies for performing this " meta-design " for artificial neural systems are reviewed. This work is divided into three main categories: bio-inspired representations ; developmental systems; and epigenetic simulations. Several specific network biases and their benefits to neural network design are identified in these contexts. In particular, several recent studies show a strong synergy, sometimes interchange-ability, between developmental and epigenetic processes—a topic that has remained largely under-explored in the literature.},

This contribution proposes a frame- work grounded in optimal transport, for the specific characterization of a system and the automatic detection of abnormal events. This method is evaluated on acoustic dataset and demonstrate the superiority of met- rics derived from optimal transport on the Euclidean ones.

BCI either provide a new interface for controlling solution mobility (e.g. wheelchair) or monitoring the state of user during his/her journey. This would be possible by implementing these interfaces on Embedded Systems (ES). However, because of the BCI sophisticated data processing and the ES limited computation performances, the computation time for a real-time use of the BCI on an ES is a limitation. Hence in this work, we investigate and evaluate the parallelization and acceleration performances, on a Raspberry Pi 2 model B (RPi) board, of an STFT-based algorithm for estimating cognitive workload from an Electroencephalographic (EEG) signal. This is done based on multi-core CPU and GPU architectures of the used RPi. Results show that the parallelized implementation using the CPU runs up to × 4 faster than a simple implementation. Compared to CPU of intel-CORE i3 processor, the GPU of the RPi revealed large difference in computation time.},

The high complexity and the large amount of information driven by novelization in the model raise several issues and delaying its wide adoption in the industrial world. One of the most important is the visualization: professionals have difficulties to find out the relevant information for their job. Actual solutions suffer from two limitations: the BIM models information are processed manually and insignificant information are simply hidden, leading to inconsistencies in the building model. This paper describes a system relying on an ontological representation of the building information to label automatically the building elements. Depending on the user's department, the visualization is modified according to these labels by automatically adjusting the colors and image properties based on a saliency model. The proposed saliency model incorporates several adaptations to fit the specificities of architectural images.},

	abstract = {The complex task of Electric Powered Wheelchairs (EPW) prescription relies mainly on personal experience and subjective observations despite standardized processes and protocols. The most informative measurements come from joystick monitoring, but recording direct joystick outputs require to disassemble the joystick. We propose a new solution called "SenseJoy" that is easy to plug on a joystick and is suitable to characterize the driver behavior by estimating the joystick command. Methods: SenseJoy is a pluggable system embedded on EPW built with a 3D accelerometer and a 2D gyrometer placed within the joystick and another 3D accelerometer located at the basis of the joystick. Data is sampled at 39 Hz and processed offline. First, SenseJoy sensitivity is assessed on wheelchair driving tasks performed by a group of 8 drivers (31 ± 8 years old, including one driver with left hemiplegia, one with cerebral palsy) in a lab environment. Direct joystick measurements are compared with SenseJoy estimations in different driving exercises. A second group of 5 drivers is recorded in the ecological context of a rehabilitation center (41 ± 10 years old, with two tetraplegic drivers, one tetraplegic driver with cognitive disorder, one driver post-stroke, one driver with right hemiplegia). The measurements from all groups of drivers are evaluated with an unsupervised statistical analysis, to estimate driving profile clusters. Results: The SenseJoy is able to measure the EPW joystick inclination angles with a resolution of 1.31\% and 1.23\% in backward/forward and left/right directions respectively. A statistical validation ensures that the classical joystick-based indicators are equivalent when acquired with the SenseJoy or with a direct joystick output connection. Using an unsupervised methodology, based on a similarity matrix between subjects, it is possible to characterize the driver profile from real data. Conclusion: SenseJoy is a pluggable system for assessing the joystick controls during EPW driving tasks. This system can be plugged on any EPW equipped with a joystick control interface. We demonstrate that it correctly estimates the performance indicators and it is able to characterize driving profile. The system is suitable and efficient to assist therapists in their recommendation, by providing objective measures with a fast installation process.},

	abstract = {Introduction Respiratory-related evoked potential (RREP) are well established cerebral correlates of respiratory perceptions. The early components N1/P1 reflect first-order sensory processing of afferent respiratory signals in brain sensorimotor regions while the late ones P2/P3 involve higher-order cognitive processing [1]. The current stimuli used to elicited RREP are short occlusions at the onset of an inspiration or a transiant interruption of the inspiration [1]. Durations of the inspiratory occlusion do not affect RREP components [2] while there is a linear relationship between inspiratory loads and RREP components amplitudes. Moreover, an inspiration load need to reach some threshold value to elicit RREP [1,3]. Here, we investigated whether supra-threshold load inspiration could induce RREP without occlusion. Methods: EEG was synchronously recorded with the respiratory signals in 11 healthy volunteers breathing into a mouthpiece connected to a non-rebreathing valve. Four consecutives inspiration loads were produced by a pressure-threshold device connected to the non-rebreathing valve: no\_Load, 10, 20 and 30 cmH2O/L/sec. Each load was presented during 5 minutes and there is a 3-min resting time between two consecutives loads presentations. Magnitude estimation (ME) for each load was scored with the A1 subscale of the Multi-dimensional profile of dyspnea. Inspiration onset time locked EEG epochs were averaged for each breathing conditions and examined for presence of RREP components. Results: The no\_load condition did not elicit any peak of RREP, but 10, 20 and 30 cmH2O/L/sec produced N1 and P3 RREP components with amplitudes correlating with the loads as well as the loads' magnitude estimation. Mean amplitudes of the N1 and P3 RREP components for 10, 20 and 30 cmH2O/L/sec were respectively 3.6 ±0.5, 5.6 ±0.9, 3.8 ±1.3 and-4.5 ±1.3,-11.4 ±2.4,-7.6 ±2.2 µV. Conclusion: Supra-threshold load inspiration could induce RREP without occlusion. This method should be compared with the standard inspiration occlusion method.},

In this work, we aim to improve the multi-class classification and to reduce the required EEG channel in motor imagery-based BCI by subject-specific time-frequency selection. Our method is based on a criterion namely Fisher discriminant analysis-type F-score to simultaneously select the optimal frequency band and time segment for multi-class classification. The proposed method uses only few Laplacian EEG channels (C3, Cz and C4) located around the sensorimotor area for classification. Applied to a standard multi-class BCI dataset (BCI competition III dataset IIIa), our method leads to better classification performance and smaller standard deviation across subjects compared to the state-of-art methods. Moreover , adding artifacts contaminated trials to the training dataset does not necessarily deteriorate our classification results, indicating that our method is tolerant to artifacts.},

Most existing methods choose key channels based on spatial information without optimization of time segment for classification.

The F score is a novel simplified measure derived from Fisher's discrimi-nant analysis for evaluating the discriminative power of a group of features. The experimental results on a standard dataset (BCI competition III dataset IVa) show that our method can efficiently reduce the number of channels (from 118 channels to 9 in average) without a decrease in mean classification accuracy.

	abstract = {To enforce a widespread use of efficient and easy to use brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), the inter-subject robustness should be increased and the number of electrodes should be reduced. These two key issues are addressed in this contribution, proposing a novel method to identify subject-specific time-frequency characteristics with a minimal number of electrodes. In this method, two alternative criteria, time-frequency discrimination factor (TFDF) and F score, are proposed to evaluate the discriminative power of time-frequency regions. Distinct from classical measures (e.g., Fisher criterion, r 2 coefficient), the TFDF is based on the neurophysiologic phenomena, on which the motor imagery BCI paradigm relies, rather than only from statistics. F score is based on the popular Fisher's discriminant and purely data driven; however, it differs from traditional measures since it provides a simple and effective measure for quantifying the discriminative power of a multi-dimensional feature vector. The proposed method is tested on BCI competition IV datasets IIa and IIb for discriminating right and left hand motor imagery. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our method based on both criteria led to comparable or even better classification results, while using fewer electrodes (i.e., only two bipolar channels, C3 and C4). This work indicates that time-frequency optimization can not only improve the classification performance but also contribute to reducing the number of electrodes required in motor imagery BCIs.},

In feedback, these oscillations affect the electrochemical processes within the neurons, influencing the timing and the number of action potentials. It is unclear whether this influence should be considered only as noise or it has some functional role in neural communication. Through computer simulations we investigated the effect of various sinusoidal extracellular oscillations on the timing and number of action potentials. Each simulation is based on a multicompartment model of a single neuron, which is stimulated through spatially distributed synaptic activations. A thorough analysis is conducted on a large number of simulations with different models of CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons which are modeled using realistic morphologies and active ion conductances. We demonstrated that the influence of the weak extracellular oscillations, which are commonly present in the brain, is rather stochastic and modest. We found that the stronger fields, which are spontaneously present in the brain only in some particular cases (e.g., during seizures) or that can be induced externally, could significantly modulate spike timings.},

	abstract = {The correct ventilation for patients in intensive care units plays a critical role for the prognostic and the recovery during the stay in the hospital. Desynchronization between the ventilator and the patient is an important source of stress, emphasized by the lack of communication due to intubation or loss of consciousness. This contribution proposes a novel approach based on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity to detect breathing effort. Relying both on recent neuroscience finding on respiratory-related evoked potential and on latest development of information geometry, the proposed approach elaborates on Rieman-nian distances between EEG covariance matrices to differentiate among different respiratory loads. The results demonstrate that this approach outperform existing state-of-the-art methods quantitatively, in terms of mean accuracy, and qualitatively, being able to predict level of breathing discomfort.},

	abstract = {Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) try to interpret brain signals , such as EEG , to issue some command or to characterize the cognitive states of the subjects. A strong limitation is that BCI tasks require a high concentration of the user , de facto limiting the length of experiment and the size of the dataset. Furthermore , several BCI paradigms depend on rare events , as for event-related potentials , also reducing the number of training examples available. A common strategy in machine learning when dealing with scarce data is called data augmentation ; new samples are generated by applying chosen transformations on the original dataset. In this contribution , we propose a scheme to adapt data augmentation in EEG-based BCI with a Riemannian standpoint : geometrical properties of EEG covariance matrix are taken into account to generate new training samples. Neural network are good candidates to benefit from such training scheme and a simple multi-layer perceptron offers good results . Experimental validation is conducted on two datasets : an SSVEP experiment with few training samples in each class and an error potential experiment with unbalanced classes (NER Kaggle competition).},

This paper addresses the emerging problem of comparing multivari-ate overcomplete dictionaries. Despite a recurrent need to rely on a distance for learning or assessing multivariate overcomplete dictionaries , no metrics in their underlying spaces have yet been proposed. Henceforth we propose to study overcomplete representations from the perspective of matrix manifolds. We consider distances between multivariate dictionaries as distances between their spans which reveal to be elements of a Grassmannian manifold. We introduce set-metrics defined on Grassmannian spaces and study their properties both theoretically and numerically. Thanks to the introduced met-rics, experimental convergences of dictionary learning algorithms are assessed on synthetic datasets. Set-metrics are embedded in a clustering algorithm for a qualitative analysis of real EEG signals for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). The obtained clusters of subjects are associated with subject performances. This is a major method-ological advance to understand the BCI-inefficiency phenomenon and to predict the ability of a user to interact with a BCI.},

This paper speciﬁcally investigates the emergence of behavioral synchronization and the division of labor in a foraging swarm of robotic agents. A deterministic model is proposed and used by each agent to decide whether it goes foraging, based on local cues about its fellow ants' behavior. This individual model, based on the competition of two spiking neurons, results in a self-organized division of labor at the population level. Depending on the strength and occurrences of interactions among individuals, the population behavior displays either an asynchronous, or a synchronous aperiodic, or a synchronous periodic division of labor. Further, the beneﬁts of synchronized individual behaviors in terms of overall foraging efﬁciency are highlighted in a 2D spatial simulation.},

Two experimental validations are conducted to demonstrate the interests of this neural-based method. The ﬁrst set of experiments compares the noise resistance of a classical DOG ﬁltering method and the neuronal DOG method on a synthetic image. The other experiment explores the edges recovery ability on a natural image. The results show that the neural-based DOG ﬁltering method is more resistant to noise and provides a better edge preservation than classical DOG ﬁltering method.},

We define a new methodology in the context of assistive robotics: it is an hybrid approach where a physical interface is complemented by a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). An implementation of such methodology is proposed, using a 3D touchless interface for continuous control and a steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI for triggering specific actions. We describe a novel algorithm for classification of SSVEP signals based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Its reliability and robustness are assessed in an online setup and its results are compared to existing algorithms. Finally, an experimental evaluation of the proposed system is performed with a 3D navigation task in a Virtual Environment (VE). The system is also embedded on an assistive robotic arm exoskeleton to validate its feasibility.},

	abstract = {The firstgeneration of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) classifies multi-channel electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, enhanced by optimized spatial filters.The second generation directly classifies covariance matrices estimated on EEG signals, based on straightforward algorithms such as the minimum-distance-to-Riemannian-mean (MDRM). Classification results vary greatly depending on the chosen Riemannian distance or divergence, whose definitions and reference implementations are spread across a wide mathematical literature. This paper reviews all the Riemannian distances and divergences to process covariance matrices, with an implementation compatible with BCI constraints. The impact of using different metrics is assessed on a steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) dataset, evaluating centers of classes and classification accuracy. Riemannian approaches embed crucial properties to process EEG data. The Riemannian centers of classes outperform Euclidean ones both in offline and online setups. Some Riemannian distances and divergences have better performances in terms of classification accuracy, while others have appealing computational efficiency.},

	abstract = {Calibration is still an important issue for user experience in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). Common experimental designs often involve a lengthy training period that raises the cognitive fatigue, before even starting to use the BCI. Reducing or suppressing this subject-dependent calibration is possible by relying on advanced machine learning techniques, such as transfer learning. Building on Riemannian BCI, we present a simple and effective scheme to train a classifier on data recorded from different subjects, to reduce the calibration while preserving good performances. The main novelty of this paper is to propose a unique approach that could be applied on very different paradigms. To demonstrate the robustness of this approach, we conducted a meta-analysis on multiple datasets for three BCI paradigms: motor imagery, eventrelated potentials (P300) and SSVEP. Relying on the MOABB open source framework to ensure the reproducibility of the experiments and the statistical analysis, the results clearly show that the proposed approach could be applied on any kind of BCI paradigm and in most of the cases to significantly improve the classifier reliability. We point out some key features to further improve transfer learning methods.},

	abstract = {Dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional electroencephalography (EEG) covariance matrices is crucial for effective utilization of Riemannian geometry in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). In this paper, we propose a novel similaritybased classification method that relies on dimensionality reduction of EEG covariance matrices. Conventionally, the dimension of the original high-dimensional space is reduced by projecting into one low-dimensional space, and the similarity is learned only based on the single space. In contrast, our method, MUltiple SUbspace Mdm Estimation (MUSUME), obtains multiple low-dimensional spaces that enhance class separability by solving the proposed optimization problem, then the similarity is learned in each low-dimensional space. This multiple projection approach encourages finding the space that is more useful for similarity learning. Experimental evaluation with high-dimensionality EEG datasets (128 channels) confirmed that MUSUME proved significant improvement for classification (p {\textless} 0.001) and also it showed the potential to beat the existing method relying on only one subspace representation.},
