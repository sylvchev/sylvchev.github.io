    <p>The complex task of Electric Powered Wheelchairs (EPW) prescription relies mainly on personal experience and subjective observations despite standardized processes and protocols. The most informative measurements come from joystick monitoring, but recording direct joystick outputs require to disassemble the joystick. We propose a new solution called "SenseJoy" that is easy to plug on a joystick and is suitable to characterize the driver behavior by estimating the joystick command. Methods: SenseJoy is a pluggable system embedded on EPW built with a 3D accelerometer and a 2D gyrometer placed within the joystick and another 3D accelerometer located at the basis of the joystick. Data is sampled at 39 Hz and processed offline. First, SenseJoy sensitivity is assessed on wheelchair driving tasks performed by a group of 8 drivers (31 ± 8 years old, including one driver with left hemiplegia, one with cerebral palsy) in a lab environment. Direct joystick measurements are compared with SenseJoy estimations in different driving exercises. A second group of 5 drivers is recorded in the ecological context of a rehabilitation center (41 ± 10 years old, with two tetraplegic drivers, one tetraplegic driver with cognitive disorder, one driver post-stroke, one driver with right hemiplegia). The measurements from all groups of drivers are evaluated with an unsupervised statistical analysis, to estimate driving profile clusters. Results: The SenseJoy is able to measure the EPW joystick inclination angles with a resolution of 1.31% and 1.23% in backward/forward and left/right directions respectively. A statistical validation ensures that the classical joystick-based indicators are equivalent when acquired with the SenseJoy or with a direct joystick output connection. Using an unsupervised methodology, based on a similarity matrix between subjects, it is possible to characterize the driver profile from real data. Conclusion: SenseJoy is a pluggable system for assessing the joystick controls during EPW driving tasks. This system can be plugged on any EPW equipped with a joystick control interface. We demonstrate that it correctly estimates the performance indicators and it is able to characterize driving profile. The system is suitable and efficient to assist therapists in their recommendation, by providing objective measures with a fast installation process.</p>

    <p>Rehabilitation exoskeletons require a control interface for the direct transfer of mechanical power and exchange of information in order to assist the patient in his/her movements. By using co-contraction indexes (CCI), it is possible to accurately characterize human movement and joint stability. But when dealing with human movement disorders, no existing index allows to achieve neuro-motor control with bio-kinematic sensors. Thus, we propose a neuro-motor interactive method for lower-body exoskeleton control. A novel dynamic index called neuro-motor index (NMI) is introduced to estimate the relation between muscular co-contraction derived from electromyography signals (EMG) and joint angles. To estimate the correlation in the state space and enhance the precision of the NMI, we describe an estimation method relying on a two-way analysis of canonical correlation (CCA). A thorough assessment is presented, by conducting two studies on control subjects and on patients with abnormal gait in a medical environment. i) An offline study on control patients showed that NMI captures the complex variation induced by changing walking speed more accurately than CCI, ii) an online study, applied on successive gait cycles of patients with abnormal walk indicates that the existing CCI have a low accuracy related with joint angles while it is significantly higher with NMI.</p>

    <p>Assisting users and restoring human locomotion for patients with lower limb spasticity is a challenging task. Studies on gait disorders are rare where there is an important variability in movement parameters between patients. Those patients could benefit the most from rehabilitation and assistive mechatronic devices; there is no generic controlling scheme or any dynamical gain indicator. This contribution introduces a bio-kinematic index which is called Neuro-motor index (NMI), based on electromyographic (EMG) and joint angles measurements. NMI is derived from the nonlinear regression with a combination of two co-contraction indices (CCI), which allows addressing the variability of walking situations. This new index is evaluated on patients with cerebral palsy and a stroke. Then, the estimation error was calculated in comparison with the other co-contraction indices. This estimation shows that this index has the highest signification of joint angles prediction. Thus it can be suitable in adaptive rehabilitation control for spasticity cases.</p>

    <p>Anomaly detection is of crucial importance in industrial environment, especially in the context of predictive maintenance. As it is very costly to add an extra monitoring layer on production machines, non-invasive solutions are favored to watch for precursory clue indicating the possible need for a maintenance operation. Those clues are to be detected in evolving and highly variable working environment, calling for online and unsupervised methods. This contribution proposes a frame- work grounded in optimal transport, for the specific characterization of a system and the automatic detection of abnormal events. This method is evaluated on acoustic dataset and demonstrate the superiority of met- rics derived from optimal transport on the Euclidean ones. The proposed method is shown to outperform one-class SVM on real datasets, which is the state-of-the-art method for anomaly detection.</p>

    <p>Les progrès en analyse des signaux cérébraux pour un décodage en temps réel ont permis des avancées importantes pour les interfaces cérébrales.
Ces interfaces cérébrales ou brain-computer interfaces (BCI) permettent de contrôler ou d’échanger des commandes avec un système en nécessitant pas ou peu de capacités physiques.
Elles offrent une solution adaptée pour les personnes en situation de handicap.
Dans leur forme actuelle, elles requièrent toutefois une bonne capacité de concentration pour fonctionner correctement.
Ces BCI ont connu un rapide essor grâce aux méthodes d’apprentissage statistique, mais elles font face à deux verrous scientifiques.
Le premier concerne la puissance du signal, qui est très faible, et les bruits environnants qui contaminent les enregistrements de signaux cérébraux, avec des niveaux bien supérieurs à celui du signal d’intérêt.
Le second point concerne les variabilités individuelles qui peuvent réduire les algorithmes à des prédictions au niveau de la chance pour 10 à 20}% des sujets.

Les travaux présentés dans ce manuscrit abordent les aspects tant expérimentaux que théoriques pour aborder ces deux problèmes.
Les approches en traitement du signal utilisées pour travailler sur les signaux cérébraux peuvent dans certains cas s’appliquer sur d’autres types séries temporelles, par exemple pour des applications industrielles sur la détection d’anomalie.
Toutes ces approches sont développées avec des outils libres pour une science ouverte et diffusable, en apportant quand c’est possible des contributions aux logiciels libres.</p>

    <p>The correct ventilation for patients in intensive care units plays a critical role for the prognostic and the recovery during the stay in the hospital. Desynchronization between the ventilator and the patient is an important source of stress, emphasized by the lack of communication due to intubation or loss of consciousness. This contribution proposes a novel approach based on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity to detect breathing effort. Relying both on recent neuroscience finding on respiratory-related evoked potential and on latest development of information geometry, the proposed approach elaborates on Rieman-nian distances between EEG covariance matrices to differentiate among different respiratory loads. The results demonstrate that this approach outperform existing state-of-the-art methods quantitatively, in terms of mean accuracy, and qualitatively, being able to predict level of breathing discomfort.</p>

    <p>Introduction Respiratory-related evoked potential (RREP) are well established cerebral correlates of respiratory perceptions. The early components N1/P1 reflect first-order sensory processing of afferent respiratory signals in brain sensorimotor regions while the late ones P2/P3 involve higher-order cognitive processing [1]. The current stimuli used to elicited RREP are short occlusions at the onset of an inspiration or a transiant interruption of the inspiration [1]. Durations of the inspiratory occlusion do not affect RREP components [2] while there is a linear relationship between inspiratory loads and RREP components amplitudes. Moreover, an inspiration load need to reach some threshold value to elicit RREP [1,3]. Here, we investigated whether supra-threshold load inspiration could induce RREP without occlusion. Methods: EEG was synchronously recorded with the respiratory signals in 11 healthy volunteers breathing into a mouthpiece connected to a non-rebreathing valve. Four consecutives inspiration loads were produced by a pressure-threshold device connected to the non-rebreathing valve: no_Load, 10, 20 and 30 cmH2O/L/sec. Each load was presented during 5 minutes and there is a 3-min resting time between two consecutives loads presentations. Magnitude estimation (ME) for each load was scored with the A1 subscale of the Multi-dimensional profile of dyspnea. Inspiration onset time locked EEG epochs were averaged for each breathing conditions and examined for presence of RREP components. Results: The no_load condition did not elicit any peak of RREP, but 10, 20 and 30 cmH2O/L/sec produced N1 and P3 RREP components with amplitudes correlating with the loads as well as the loads’ magnitude estimation. Mean amplitudes of the N1 and P3 RREP components for 10, 20 and 30 cmH2O/L/sec were respectively 3.6 ±0.5, 5.6 ±0.9, 3.8 ±1.3 and-4.5 ±1.3,-11.4 ±2.4,-7.6 ±2.2 µV. Conclusion: Supra-threshold load inspiration could induce RREP without occlusion. This method should be compared with the standard inspiration occlusion method.</p>

    <p>The essential task of a motor imagery brain–computer interface (BCI) is to extract the motor imagery-related features from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for classifying motor intentions. However, the optimal frequency band and time segment for extracting such features differ from subject to subject. In this work, we aim to improve the multi-class classification and to reduce the required EEG channel in motor imagery-based BCI by subject-specific time-frequency selection. Our method is based on a criterion namely Fisher discriminant analysis-type F-score to simultaneously select the optimal frequency band and time segment for multi-class classification. The proposed method uses only few Laplacian EEG channels (C3, Cz and C4) located around the sensorimotor area for classification. Applied to a standard multi-class BCI dataset (BCI competition III dataset IIIa), our method leads to better classification performance and smaller standard deviation across subjects compared to the state-of-art methods. Moreover , adding artifacts contaminated trials to the training dataset does not necessarily deteriorate our classification results, indicating that our method is tolerant to artifacts.</p>

    <p>Keeping a minimal number of channels is essential for designing a portable brain–computer interface system for daily usage. Most existing methods choose key channels based on spatial information without optimization of time segment for classification. This paper proposes a novel subject-specific channel selection method based on a criterion called F score to realize the parameterization of both time segment and channel positions. The F score is a novel simplified measure derived from Fisher’s discrimi-nant analysis for evaluating the discriminative power of a group of features. The experimental results on a standard dataset (BCI competition III dataset IVa) show that our method can efficiently reduce the number of channels (from 118 channels to 9 in average) without a decrease in mean classification accuracy. Compared to two state-of-the-art methods in channel selection, our method leads to comparable or even better classification results with less selected channels.</p>

    <p>Using Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) as an assistive technology aims at providing an innovative solution adapted to subjects’ disabilities. BCI either provide a new interface for controlling solution mobility (e.g. wheelchair) or monitoring the state of user during his/her journey. This would be possible by implementing these interfaces on Embedded Systems (ES). However, because of the BCI sophisticated data processing and the ES limited computation performances, the computation time for a real-time use of the BCI on an ES is a limitation. Hence in this work, we investigate and evaluate the parallelization and acceleration performances, on a Raspberry Pi 2 model B (RPi) board, of an STFT-based algorithm for estimating cognitive workload from an Electroencephalographic (EEG) signal. This is done based on multi-core CPU and GPU architectures of the used RPi. Results show that the parallelized implementation using the CPU runs up to × 4 faster than a simple implementation. Compared to CPU of intel-CORE i3 processor, the GPU of the RPi revealed large difference in computation time.</p>

    <p>Building information modeling opened new hori- zons for designing future urban spaces. Logistics and mobility issues are difficult to take into account during the construction process, as they require a precise global vision and the access to information yields by different building departments (architecture, methods, structure...). This contribution proposes a novel approach, based on a collaborative framework, to develop the building model, that is to ensure the quality of logistic and mobility during construction, with a time-efficient methodology.</p>

    <p>Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) try to interpret brain signals , such as EEG , to issue some command or to characterize the cognitive states of the subjects. A strong limitation is that BCI tasks require a high concentration of the user , de facto limiting the length of experiment and the size of the dataset. Furthermore , several BCI paradigms depend on rare events , as for event-related potentials , also reducing the number of training examples available. A common strategy in machine learning when dealing with scarce data is called data augmentation ; new samples are generated by applying chosen transformations on the original dataset. In this contribution , we propose a scheme to adapt data augmentation in EEG-based BCI with a Riemannian standpoint : geometrical properties of EEG covariance matrix are taken into account to generate new training samples. Neural network are good candidates to benefit from such training scheme and a simple multi-layer perceptron offers good results . Experimental validation is conducted on two datasets : an SSVEP experiment with few training samples in each class and an error potential experiment with unbalanced classes (NER Kaggle competition).</p>

    <p>Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a recent construction process based on a 3D model, containing every component related to the building achievement. Architects, structure engineers, method engineers, and others departments to the building process work in collaboration on this model through the design-to-construction cycle. The high complexity and the large amount of information driven by novelization in the model raise several issues and delaying its wide adoption in the industrial world. One of the most important is the visualization: professionals have difficulties to find out the relevant information for their job. Actual solutions suffer from two limitations: the BIM models information are processed manually and insignificant information are simply hidden, leading to inconsistencies in the building model. This paper describes a system relying on an ontological representation of the building information to label automatically the building elements. Depending on the user’s department, the visualization is modified according to these labels by automatically adjusting the colors and image properties based on a saliency model. The proposed saliency model incorporates several adaptations to fit the specificities of architectural images.</p>

    <p>Muscle noises, line noises and eye movements are the main interferences that make difficulties when interpreting and analyzing electroencephalographic signals. Many methods have been proposed for artifacts removing from EEG measurements, and especially those arising from an ocular source. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) have been proposed to remove ocular artifacts from multichannel EEG. In contrast to this, we present a new algorithm for ocular artifacts removal from a single electroencephalographic channel recording. This method is based on a set of information on brain wave frequencies. Our results on EEG data, collected from healthy subjects, show that our algorithm can effectively detect and remove ocular artifacts in EEG recordings.</p>

    <p>In the context of assistive technologies, it is important to design systems that adapt to the user specificities, and to rely as much as possible on the residual capacities of each user. We define a new methodology in the context of assistive robotics: it is an hybrid approach where a physical interface is complemented by a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). An implementation of such methodology is proposed, using a 3D touchless interface for continuous control and a steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI for triggering specific actions. We describe a novel algorithm for classification of SSVEP signals based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Its reliability and robustness are assessed in an online setup and its results are compared to existing algorithms. Finally, an experimental evaluation of the proposed system is performed with a 3D navigation task in a Virtual Environment (VE). The system is also embedded on an assistive robotic arm exoskeleton to validate its feasibility.</p>

    <p>Overcomplete representations and dictionary learning algorithms are attracting a growing interest in the machine learning community. This paper addresses the emerging problem of comparing multivari-ate overcomplete dictionaries. Despite a recurrent need to rely on a distance for learning or assessing multivariate overcomplete dictionaries , no metrics in their underlying spaces have yet been proposed. Henceforth we propose to study overcomplete representations from the perspective of matrix manifolds. We consider distances between multivariate dictionaries as distances between their spans which reveal to be elements of a Grassmannian manifold. We introduce set-metrics defined on Grassmannian spaces and study their properties both theoretically and numerically. Thanks to the introduced met-rics, experimental convergences of dictionary learning algorithms are assessed on synthetic datasets. Set-metrics are embedded in a clustering algorithm for a qualitative analysis of real EEG signals for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). The obtained clusters of subjects are associated with subject performances. This is a major method-ological advance to understand the BCI-inefficiency phenomenon and to predict the ability of a user to interact with a BCI.</p>

    <p>Neural communication generates oscillations of electric potential in the extracellular medium. In feedback, these oscillations affect the electrochemical processes within the neurons, influencing the timing and the number of action potentials. It is unclear whether this influence should be considered only as noise or it has some functional role in neural communication. Through computer simulations we investigated the effect of various sinusoidal extracellular oscillations on the timing and number of action potentials. Each simulation is based on a multicompartment model of a single neuron, which is stimulated through spatially distributed synaptic activations. A thorough analysis is conducted on a large number of simulations with different models of CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons which are modeled using realistic morphologies and active ion conductances. We demonstrated that the influence of the weak extracellular oscillations, which are commonly present in the brain, is rather stochastic and modest. We found that the stronger fields, which are spontaneously present in the brain only in some particular cases (e.g., during seizures) or that can be induced externally, could significantly modulate spike timings.</p>

    <p>To enforce a widespread use of efficient and easy to use brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), the inter-subject robustness should be increased and the number of electrodes should be reduced. These two key issues are addressed in this contribution, proposing a novel method to identify subject-specific time-frequency characteristics with a minimal number of electrodes. In this method, two alternative criteria, time-frequency discrimination factor (TFDF) and F score, are proposed to evaluate the discriminative power of time-frequency regions. Distinct from classical measures (e.g., Fisher criterion, r 2 coefficient), the TFDF is based on the neurophysiologic phenomena, on which the motor imagery BCI paradigm relies, rather than only from statistics. F score is based on the popular Fisher’s discriminant and purely data driven; however, it differs from traditional measures since it provides a simple and effective measure for quantifying the discriminative power of a multi-dimensional feature vector. The proposed method is tested on BCI competition IV datasets IIa and IIb for discriminating right and left hand motor imagery. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our method based on both criteria led to comparable or even better classification results, while using fewer electrodes (i.e., only two bipolar channels, C3 and C4). This work indicates that time-frequency optimization can not only improve the classification performance but also contribute to reducing the number of electrodes required in motor imagery BCIs.</p>

    <p>In this introduction and review—like in the book which follows—we explore the hypothesis that adaptive growth is a means of producing brain-like machines. The emulation of neural development can incorporate desirable characteristics of natural neural systems into engineered designs. The introduction begins with a review of neural development and neural models. Next, artificial development— the use of a developmentally-inspired stage in engineering design—is introduced. Several strategies for performing this " meta-design " for artificial neural systems are reviewed. This work is divided into three main categories: bio-inspired representations ; developmental systems; and epigenetic simulations. Several specific network biases and their benefits to neural network design are identified in these contexts. In particular, several recent studies show a strong synergy, sometimes interchange-ability, between developmental and epigenetic processes—a topic that has remained largely under-explored in the literature.</p>

    <p>Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) rely on brain waves signal, such as electro-encephalogram (EEG) recording, to endow a disabled user with non-muscular communication. Given the very low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG, a signal enhancement phase is crucial for ensuring decent performances in BCI systems. Several methods have been proposed for EEG signal enhancement, such as Independent Component Analysis, Common Spatial Pattern, and Principal Component Analysis. We show that Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), initially introduced to SSVEP-based BCI as a feature extraction method, is a good candidate for such preprocessing state. Evaluation is performed on a recording from 5 subjects during a BCI task based on Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP). The authors demonstrate that CCA significantly improves classification performances in SSVEP-based BCIs.</p>

    <p>Several muscular degenerative diseases alter motor abilities of large muscles but spare smaller muscles, e.g. keeping hand motor skills relatively unaffected while upper limbs ones are altered. Thus, hand movements could be be used to control an arm exoskeleton for rehabilitation and assistive purpose. Using an infra-red sensors (IR) based interface for the exoskeleton control, this paper describes the learning part of the system, endowing the system with a fast online calibration and adaptation abilities. This learning component shows good results and have been successfully implemented on the real system.</p>

    <p>Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) is widely used for constructing spatial filters to extract features for motor-imagery-based BCI. One main parameter in CSP-based classification is the number of spatial filters used. An automatic method relying on Rayleigh quotient is presented to estimate its optimal value for each subject. Based on an existing dataset, we validate the contribution of the proposed method through a study of the effect of this parameter on the classification performance. The evaluation on testing data shows that the estimated subject-specific optimal values yield better performances than the recommanded value in the literature.</p>

    <p>Biological populations often exhibit complex and efﬁcient behaviors, where temporal and spatial couplings at the macro-scale population level emerge from interactions at the micro-scale individual level, without any centralized control. This paper speciﬁcally investigates the emergence of behavioral synchronization and the division of labor in a foraging swarm of robotic agents. A deterministic model is proposed and used by each agent to decide whether it goes foraging, based on local cues about its fellow ants’ behavior. This individual model, based on the competition of two spiking neurons, results in a self-organized division of labor at the population level. Depending on the strength and occurrences of interactions among individuals, the population behavior displays either an asynchronous, or a synchronous aperiodic, or a synchronous periodic division of labor. Further, the beneﬁts of synchronized individual behaviors in terms of overall foraging efﬁciency are highlighted in a 2D spatial simulation.</p>

    <p>The deep learning paradigm tackles problems on which shallow architectures (e.g. SVM) are affected by the curse of dimensionality. As part of a two-stage learning scheme involving multiple layers of non-linear processing a set of statistically robust features is automatically extracted from the data. The present tutorial introducing the ESANN deep learning special session details the state-of-the-art models and summarizes the current understanding of this learning approach which is a reference for many difficult classification tasks.</p>

    <p>Human vision rely on attention to select only a few regions to process and thus reduce the complexity and the processing time of visual task. Artificial vision systems can benefit from a bio-inspired attentional process relying on neural models. In such applications, what is the most efficient neural model: spiked-based or frequency-based? We propose an evaluation of both neural model, in term of complexity and quality of results (on artificial and natural images).</p>

    <p>This contribution describes a bio-inspired image ﬁltering method using spiking neurons. Bio-inspired approaches aim at identifying key properties of biological systems or models and proposing efﬁcient implementations of these properties. The neural image ﬁltering method takes advantage of the temporal integration behavior of spiking neurons. Two experimental validations are conducted to demonstrate the interests of this neural-based method. The ﬁrst set of experiments compares the noise resistance of a classical DOG ﬁltering method and the neuronal DOG method on a synthetic image. The other experiment explores the edges recovery ability on a natural image. The results show that the neural-based DOG ﬁltering method is more resistant to noise and provides a better edge preservation than classical DOG ﬁltering method.</p>

    <p>Spiking neurons seem to capture important characteristics of biological neurons with relatively simple models. Their main interest is their ability to code information as discrete events. We have investigated the possible contributions of these models to artficial vision. Due to vision constraints, particularly for processing time, we use simple spiking neural models. A spiking neuron network architecture is described for encoding and extracting saliencies, thanks to the discretization induced by spiking neurons. The saliency map is a combination, in space and temporal domain, of visual modality maps (contrasts, orientations and colors) for different spatial scales. We propose a neural ﬁltering method for building the modality maps. This method implements a process, similar to convolution ﬁltering, by gradual approximation : the more processing time is allowed to the algorithm, the better is the approximation. The architecture ranks the saliencies in the order of their interest, with the most important encoded ﬁrst. Another spiking neuron network, inspired by dynamic neural ﬁelds, is attached on top of the architecture, allowing to select the most salient region and to focus on. Experimental results point out that the architecture is able to extract saliencies in a sequence of images, to select the most salient region and to focus on this region, in presence of noise or when the saliency moves.</p>
