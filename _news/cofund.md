The DATAIA DeMythif.AI Cofund project from [Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101127936) is accepted! I am the leader of this MSCA European project: we aim to hire 30 PhD students in AI-related domains (uncertainty, frugality, explainability) for the whole University Paris-Saclay
in 2024 and 2025.
